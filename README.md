 **Authors: Karim Abousamra, Robyn Berdan, Benjamin Trpcic Childs, Sabrina Ke, Taha Ali Siddiqui**
 ## **Software Description:**  
 (A short description of your software and what it does.)
 
 This is a desktop application designed to help indviduals navigate commonly used buildings on Western's Campus including Middlesex College (MC), Alumni Hall (AH), and Natural Sciences Centre (NSC). This application takes advantage of the floor plans provided by Western University to allow users to search the maps and customize aspects of them to suit their own preferences and/or needs. The application will allow users to search for rooms in buildings, locate point of interest, browse available maps, and create and store their own points of interest. In addition, an editing tool will also be included for developers to create and edit map metadata.
